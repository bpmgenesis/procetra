Yoksa Süreç Madenciliği alanında tamamen yeni misiniz ve buraya tamamen şans eseri mi geldiniz? Merak etmeyin. Aşağıda Süreç Madenciliği için kapsamlı bir rehber hazırladık. Temel bilgilerle başlayacağız ve uygulama, kullanım durumları ve olasılıklarla ilgili daha fazla ayrıntıya gireceğiz.

# What is Process Mining? How does it work?
Konuya Süreç Madenciliğinin temelleri ile başlıyoruz. 'Süreç' ile ne demek istiyoruz? Süreç Madenciliği nasıl çalışır? Nereden geldi? Avantajları nelerdir? Kimler kullanabilir? Tipik uygulama alanları nelerdir? Ve başlamak için neye ihtiyacınız var? Bütün bu soruların cevaplarını aşağıda bulacaksınız.

# Technology of Process Mining
## What is a process?
Süreç Madenciliği açısından bakarsak bir süreç, net bir başlangıç ve bitiş adımı olan aktivite adımlarından oluşan bir olaylar zinciridir. Bu süreç adımları, süreçteki bireysel eylemler veya olaylardır. Süreçin klasik örneklerinden olan pizzacı örneğini ele alırsak, bir pizza hazırlama ve pişirme sürecini ele alalım. Bir pizza türü için sipariş verilmesiyle başlar ve pizzanın teslim edilmesiyle sona erer. Bunlar başlangıç ve bitiş noktalarıdır. Bunlar ve aradaki tüm adımlar (fırını ısıtma, hamur hazırlama, malzemeleri ekleme vb.) işlem adımlarıdır.

## What is the definiton of Process Mining?
Süreç Madenciliği terimi aslında daha geniş bir şekilde süreç yönetimi alanına giren teknolojilerin ve yöntemlerin bir karışımını tanımlar. Süreç Madenciliğinin temel amacı, süreçlerin gerçekte nasıl gerçekleştiğini, ideal modelden sapıp sapmadığı veya nasıl saptığını, hangi problemlerin ortaya çıktığını, hangi optimizasyon önlemlerinin alınması gerektiğini analiz etmek ve ardından da süreci iyileştirmeye başlamaktır.

Procetra gibi modern süreç madenciliği araçları, sürecinizi görselleştirmekten fazlasını yaparlar. Bu araçları aşağıdakiler için kullanabilirsiniz:

- Süreçlerinizi derinlemesine analiz etmek
- Benchmark
- Süreçleri birbirleri ile karşılaştırmak
- Süreçleri izlemek
- İş akışlarını tetiklemek
- Süreç iyileştirmelerini keşfetmek ve planlamak

## How does it work?
Süreç Madenciliği algoritmaları, sürecin olay verilerini kullanır. Bunlar tipik günlük dosyaları değil, kurumsal bilgi sistemlerinden veya kurumsal kaynak planlama sistemlerinden farklı veritabanları ve dosyalarıdır.

Employees are very effective in creating shortcuts in your process. They can improve your workflow or be serious compliance violations, that’s why it’s so important to find them. Process Mining is the best solution to unveil the invisible net of pirate paths in your company.
The data is visualized in a process flow and shows your process as it actually happens. There are no guessing-games with Process Mining. You get a fact-based view on the events in your organization.

Verileriniz görselleştirildikten sonra analize başlayabilirsiniz. Filtre seçenekleri, problemler için kök neden analizi, farklı detay seviyeleri ve prosesinizdeki istatistiklerin detayına inebileceğiniz daha birçok fonksiyon vardır.


# History of Process Mining
## Before Process Mining
Now, you might say that the idea of analyzing data isn’t new and you are correct. However, the way we collect and analyze data is changing rapidly. Before data was readily available in digital form, people simply went through documents by hand or collected data from interviews to find useful information and deviations from the norm.

Even business processes were analyzed that way. It took a whole bunch of consultants, weeks of time, workshops, interviews and an awful lot of money to get an idea of how things were happening and what could be improved.

There were several problems with this approach because usually people have an idea of how things should happen but lack the greater picture of how things are actually happening. Then, there are also exceptions to the standard procedure. Steps might have to be redone because there was a mistake or something changed (for example, an order was changed), the process itself can evolve and change due to outside factors or process steps need to be adapted to a new situation. No one can be aware of all these exceptions and keep track of all deviations from the norm.

The results from the old approach were thus subjective, incomplete and often outdated by the time they were available.

## Early Process Mining

In the late 1990s things started to change. Large amounts of data became available digitally. Professor Wil van der Aalst (the ‘Godfather of Process Mining’) and his dedicated team found a way to use that data in combination with analytics and visualization software.

Early Process Mining was born.

Things sped up further when the economic potential of Process Mining became apparent. First generation Process Mining tools entered the market. They focused on the visualization of as-is processes and allowed for analyses, but they lacked the BI elements we can find in 2nd generation tools.

## Process Mining 2.0
The latest wave of Process Mining tools is much more advanced. It is a combination of data analytics, data mining, process analytics and Business Intelligence (BI). That means, on top of visualization and analysis (which also got improved) you now can benchmark, compare and monitor processes and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), start workflow-triggers directly from your Process Mining software and collaborate in your organization’s IT infrastructure to communicate and solve problems.

# What are the benefits of Process Mining?
Process Mining comes with serious advantages both over traditional approaches to data analysis or process management and in terms of competitiveness in the market.

## Compared to old approaches
Real processes are much more complex than the ideal model. Understanding how you’re currently doing things is crucial to come up with an improvement strategy. Process Mining has a lot of benefits compared to the traditional approach and is able to resolve the weaknesses and problems that arise during old-fashioned data gathering and analysis.

## Fast
Process Mining is much faster than the old approach to process optimization. Instead of conducting interviews and holding workshops that then need to be analyzed, the results appear at the push of a button.

## Objective
The process flow gives you a completely objective view on your real process. There is no specific lens that was applied to the view. You see your process as it is not as anyone perceives it.

## The entire picture
You get the complete picture. Where individual people know what they are doing, there usually is no-one who has an idea of the entire process. With Process Mining, you see the entire process from start to finish including every individual step. This makes it much easier to communicate problems and find optimization potential.

## Changing processes & exceptions
The process flow shows you all the paths from start to end activity in your process. This includes all exceptions, deviations from the norm, skipped steps, reworks, etc.

You can react to changing processes and find out if your target model is actually what your process should look like or if there are better ways.

Since the results are available faster, you can also react better to natural changes in the process.

## Visibility

With most processes happening digitally, it can be very hard to see how and where work is done. In the old days of huge piles of paper that moved from one desk to the other for different steps, things were easier. Process Mining makes visible what is hidden. It shows the movement of those ‘virtual stacks of paper’.

Process Mining turns a hit-or-miss guessing game into a fast, fact-based and on point picture of your actual process and allows you to utilize this picture in many ways.

## Competitive
Aside from the advantages over typical optimization procedures, Process Mining also boosts your competitiveness and puts you at the front of the digital transformation race.

## Fact-based approach
Process Mining is based on facts, not gut-feeling. The main advantage of applying Process Mining tools in your business is the ability to depict what is actually happening and to pinpoint exactly what needs to be improved and what has the highest priority.

## Continuous optimization
Because it’s fast and easy to receive results from Process Mining, it is also much easier to react to changes in the business world. It is also much easier to assign priorities and develop a comprehensive, pro-active and sustainable but also adaptable optimization strategy.

## Complete transparency & maximum visibility
You get the entire picture of your process. You may find that one of the exceptions in your as-is process is actually better than your ideal process model. You may also find that you need to deploy changes to the whole process or just too very specific stages. Whatever you find out, you gain the insights you need to develop the best optimization strategy.

## Continuous monitoring
This is not a one-time solution. You can monitor KPIs, see how your optimization measures are impacting your process performance, adapt your strategy to outside changes and stay on track while optimizing your business.

## Empower your employees
Successful companies are the sum of excellent processes – and the people who work in them. With their commitment and experience, they contribute to growth and innovation every day. With Process Mining, you can use this valuable wealth of expertise to make processes better where they are happening.

You stay informed about your actual process performance, can react to problems and changes before they become huge obstacles, maintain sustainable and successful optimization strategies, and base your decision on facts. Everyone can understand and contribute to optimization measures as a process expert to ensure the strategy is working out in the long run.

## Who can use Process Mining?

Process Mining is applied in different areas by different people for different purposes. The tools of the 2nd generation can work with millions of data points so as long as the basic event log requirements are met, there is no limit to the process you can explore. However, there are still common application areas and user types, as well as typical industries that already leverage Process Mining.

### Business Areas

Depending on the area you’re workin in, Process Mining can be used from your employees in-house and from outside service-providers.

# What do you need for Process Mining?
## Software
You need Process Mining software to start. We have our own free version. It is very user-friendly because it does a lot of the data-preprocessing, loading, and transformation for you. ;)

## Data/Event Log
You need data to analyze. Usually, this is stored in your IT system and you shouldn’t have to worry about it.

Process Mining uses data in a so-called event log. This means databases that store the following information: CaseID, Timestamp, Activity name.

Let’s go back to our example of the pizza delivery service. A typical process would look like this:

Receive order → preheat oven → prepare dough → spread sauce on dough → add toppings → bake pizza → put pizza into box → deliver

## CaseID
A case is one completed route through your process. So, for example, one completed pizza delivery. In our example every order is a new case and needs a new CaseID so that the individual process steps can be linked to a specific case.
For example Customer A orders a pepperoni pizza – that’s one case. Customer B orders a cheese pizza, a pepperoni pizza and a pizza with cheese and pineapple – that’s also one case but it has way more steps because you have to make a total of three pizzas.

## Timestamp
When did a process step happen? A timestamp either tells you when a process started, when it ended, or you have two timestamps and include start and end time. The version with two timestamps is obviously the most precise.

When did you put the pizza in the oven? That’s the start timestamp for ‘Bake pizza’. When did you take it out of the oven? That’s your end timestamp. When you don’t have an end timestamp you wouldn’t know how much time was wasted between taking the pizza out of the oven and putting it in a box. The process step ‘bake pizza’ would last until the beginning of the process step ‘put pizza in box’.

# Activity
What was done? This is the descriptor of your process steps. Activity names are usually short and on point. Examples are ‘Create PO’, ‘Send Invoice’, etc.

In our example of the pizza place activity names would be ‘preheat oven’, ‘prepare dough’, ‘add toppings’ etc.

You can add more information to your Event Log to get a more detailed analysis. For example, if you have various people baking pizza for you, you could add them to the event log. Or if you have more than one pizza place, that could also be a category. The more categories you add, the more detailed you can go with your analysis. Just keep in mind, that CaseID, Timestamp and Activity Name are mandatory while everything else is optional. Otherwise you have complete freedom in the process you want to analyze.
